Please clone this repo and add instructions on how to set it up.

### Tools ###
Feel free to use whatever tool/framework you think is appropriate to complete this exercise.

### Expected Behaviour ###
- All fields are required (at least one Area of interest).
- If any of the fields are missing a message should be shown (check visuals)
- When signing up we should show a modal with the message : "Thank you [First Name] [Last Name] from [Country]. You'll be recieving our newsletters about [List of Interests] in your [email] email."
- Although there are no responsive designs, we expect the layout to scale well in multiple viewports.
